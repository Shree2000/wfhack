Design document

## Development team:

1. Gulshan Kumar - Software Engineer (DTI)
2. Shivesh Dixit - Software Engineer (EFT)
3. Shreerang Bhatt - Software Engineer (EFT)
4. Srivatsh Agarwal - Software Engineer (CCIBT)

## Brief description of the project:
The primary objective of this project is to develop effective countermeasures against identity personification using AI-generated voice prints. This project seeks to address the growing threat of voice-based fraud and protect individuals and organizations from unauthorized access and impersonation.
