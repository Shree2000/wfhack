Liveliness detection for voice samples is crucial in various applications such as speaker verification, fraud prevention, and security systems. This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning model for determining the authenticity of voice recordings. The SVM model is trained on a dataset consisting of both genuine and spoofed voice samples.
